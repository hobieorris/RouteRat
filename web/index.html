<h2>Welcome to Route Rat!</h2>
<p>
<b>Route Rat</b> is a free extension for the <b>Mozilla Firefox</b> browser that allows you to easily save a route you have plotted on a <b>Google Maps</b>
map to your connected <b>Garmin GPS</b> device.  That's all it does! No features, settings, configuration options or other unpleasantness!
</p>
<h3>How You Use It</h3>
<p>
Once installed, use <b>Firefox</b> to go to <b>Google Maps</b> and plot out a route manually, or by using the Get Directions feature.
You can add as many additional destinations as you like and drag the route line around according to your preference.  Then, select the
<b>Route Rat</b> menu item from <b>Firefox's</b> Tools menu.  The <b>Route Rat</b> web page will open with your route data present.  Simply
connect your GPS, and when <b>Route Rat</b> recognizes it, type in the name you would like to call the route and click the Save button.
You can then disconnect your GPS, import the route using the <b>Garmin</b> Tools menu and you are ready to go.
<h3>Installation</h3>
<h4>Before You Begin</h4>
<p>
First, in order to use <b>Route Rat</b>, you must first own a <b>Garmin GPS</b> model that allows the owner to import custom routes.
To determine if your GPS is capable, consult <a href="http://developer.garmin.com/web-device/garmin-communicator-plugin/device-support-matrix" target="_blank" id="support">this chart</a>
and look for an <b>X</b> next to your model under the ROUTES column. If you don't know your model number, you can go to the
<a href="http://www8.garmin.com/products/webupdater/howtoinstall.jsp" target="_blank">Garmin WebUpdater</a> to find out.
</p>
<p>
Second, you must be using the <b>Firefox</b> browser on a computer running <b>Windows</b> or <b>Mac OS 10.5</b> or later.  <b>Firefox</b> must also have the 
free <b>Garmin Communicator</b> plugin installed in the browser, which you may get <a href="http://software.garmin.com/en-US/gcp.html" target="_blank" id="plugin">here</a> or 
from the Add-Ons Manager (Tools <span style="font-size:120%">&rarr;</span> Add-ons menu) in <b>Firefox</b>. 
</p>
<h4>Installing Route Rat</h4>
<p>
Finally, you will have to install the <b>Route Rat</b> extension in <b>Firefox</b>.  It will soon be available directly from the creators of <b>Firefox</b> via the the Add-ons
Manager, but meanwhile, it can be installed by clicking on the button below.
</p>
</div>
<div style="width: 200px;margin: 50px auto;">
	<button id="download_button" class="activebutton" onclick="window.location.href='routerat.xpi'">Install Route Rat</button>
</div>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<div class="wrapper">
<p>
To install from here, you must save the file to a known location.  Then, from the File menu in <b>Firefox</b>, open the file.  <b>Firefox</b> will prompt you to install the extension, so click on the Install button.
</p>
<p>
After installation, go to the Tools <span style="font-size:120%">&rarr;</span> Add-ons menu and show the Extensions list.  It should show both <b>Garmin Communicator</b> and <b>Route Rat</b> similar to below
</p>
<p>
<img src="Images/addons.jpg"></img>
</p>
<p>
Under the Tools menu, you will find a new menu item, <b>Route Rat</b>.  
</p>
<p>
<img src="Images/menu.jpg"></img>
</p>
<p>
If you click on it, nothing will happen!  It will only
respond when your active browser tab is <b>Google Maps</b> and will only be useful if you have already mapped your route.
</p>
<h3>Saving a Route to a GPS Device</h3>
<p>
After you have created your route and clicked the <b>Route Rat</b> item on the Tools menu, a new tab will open in your <b>Firefox</b> browser.  The first time you visit the <b>Route Rat</b> page, the <b>Garmin Communicator</b> plugin will display a warning and ask you if you wish to allow the site to access your device.
</p>
<p>
<img src="Images/garminperm.jpg"></img>
</p>
<p>
After clicking yes, you will see your route data appearing in the bottom box on the <b>Route Rat</b> page, and some messages will appear in the top.  If you are using
<b>NoScript</b> or have JavaScript disabled in the browser, you will have to enable it for this page or nothing will work.
</p>
<p>
<b>Route Rat</b> will attempt to determine if your GPS device is hooked up and available for receiving the route. If it is already
connected then you should see a message identifying the device by model number.  If it is not hooked up, a error dialog
will appear advising you to connect it and click the Find Device button, which should now be visible on the page.  Like any
other USB device, it will take ten seconds or so for Windows (or Mac) to realize a new device is connected and will show it
on its list of storage drives.  When that happens, you can click on Find Device and wait for the message informing you that
the GPS has been found.
</p>
<p>
Now you must type in a name for the route in the entry field in the centre of the form.  This is the name by which you will
find the route while using the GPS.  If you pick a name of a route that is already on the device, the GPS will append a 
number to the name so that it will be unique.  Click the Save button and wait for the message informing you that the 
saving is complete.
</p>
<p>
You may now click Exit on the page and safely disconnect your GPS. In Windows, use the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the system tray
at the bottom right of your Windows screen. I have no idea how to do this on a Mac, but there must be a way.
</p>
<h3>Using the Saved Route</h3>
<p>
Power on your GPS and go to the Tools page.  Don't select the Routes icon from this page; you won't find it there yet.
You must first Import the route to make it selectable in this section.
</p>
<h4>Importing the Route</h4>
<p>
From the Tools page on the GPS, select My Data.  From the displayed list, select Import Route(s).  If there is no menu item
for Import Route(s) in this list, your GPS model does not allow you to use routes.  If you check the link in the Installation 
section above, you can confirm this.
</p>
<p>
Find your route by the name you typed in earlier and select it.  This route will now be available in Routes section of the 
Tools page for you to select and use.
