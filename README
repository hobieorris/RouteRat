Route Rat
---------

Route Rat is a Firefox browser extension which will extract route information
from a Google Map displayed in the active tab. This information is relayed to
the Route Rat web page which invokes the Garmin Communicator browser plugin
to save this route on an attached Garmin GPS device.  

This extension works only on Windows and Mac as these are the only platforms
which support the Garmin Communicator plugin.

Route Rat is created by Hobie Orris <hobie@teksavvy.com> and is protected by
